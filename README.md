Example of an unsupervised Google Maps image classification

This example takes a google image (preloaded in the Rsenal package), 
extracts some structural properties of the land surface and applies and finally applies k-means algorithm in order to identify three clusters or types of vegetation.

unsupervised_sensory_image_classification.R contains all the code to execute the example

It is required to install devtools, leaflet, satellite, Rsenal and RColorBrewer packages.
I have to install satellite from a local zip file (satellite_0.1.0.zip). It is included in the repo.
