Example of an unsupervised Google Maps image classification

This example takes a google image (preloaded in the Rsenal package), extracts some structural properties of the land surface and applies k-means algorithm in order to identify three clusters or types of vegetation.

[View .Rmd of the project](http://joseallones.github.io/Example_unsupervised_sensor_image_classification/unsupervised_sensory_image_classification.html) 

unsupervised_sensory_image_classification.R contains all the code to execute the example

It is required to install devtools, leaflet, satellite, Rsenal and RColorBrewer packages.
I had to install the package satellite from a local zip file (satellite_0.1.0.zip). It is included in the repo.
